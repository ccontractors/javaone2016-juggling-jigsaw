== What is Gradle?

image::Mechaphant-Gradle.png[]

=== Emerge from Build Hell

* Unified, fast, reproducible builds
* Cross-platform
* Language agnostic

* A Build Tool + Cloud Services

== Project Jigsaw
image::puzzle.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Project Jigsaw

* Modularity for the Java platform
** *Reliable configuration* (goodbye _classpath_)
** *Strong encapsulation* (goodbye _com.sun_)
* Enforce strict boundaries between modules
** compile-time
** run-time

== Jigsaw modules

=== Declaring a module

.module-info.java
[source,java]
----
module com.foo.bar {
    requires org.baz.qux;
    exports com.foo.bar.alpha;
    exports com.foo.bar.beta;
}
----

=== A module

* Declares dependencies onto other modules
** optionally transitive (`public`)
* Declares a list of packages it exports
* will be found on _modulepath_

== Why it's going to break your apps

* Exports are package based
* A non-exported package is not visible to consumers
* 2 modules cannot export the same packages
* 2 modules cannot have the same internal packages

Death to *split packages*.

== How Gradle will help?

* Find a _smooth migration path_
* Prepare today, migrate when ready

== Disclaimer

<div style="color:yellow">

* Work in progress
* Backport from the software model
* Running Gradle on Jigsaw requires Gradle 3.0+
* Works with JDK 9 b119
* Breaks with JDK 9 b136
* Running those samples require `master`

== A simple project

screencast:step1[]

== Internal APIs

screencast:step2[]

== Internal APIs maintenance nightmare

=== The "Jigsaw" plugin

* _WIP_
* creates _additional_ configurations for each platform
* adds support for API
* APIs enforced on JDK < 9 too

=== Demo

screencast:step3[]

== Declaring internal APIs

=== How to declare

screencast:step4[]

=== Compilation fails!

https://gradle.com/s/xwktle5a6xfgw

== Compile avoidance

screencast:step5[]

=== Build scan

https://gradle.com/s/6tlwxiqmjxi4a

=== Compile avoidance benefits

* Doesn't recompile dependents if:
** method body changes
** parameter names change
** method order changes
** private method added/removed
* In short: if API stable, do nothing

== Declaring target platforms

screencast:step6[]

=== Build scans

* `run` only compiled the Java 8 variant of `utils`: https://gradle.com/s/mm2nlbuefyqje
* `compileJavaJava7` only compiled the Java 7 variant of `utils`: https://gradle.com/s/e6d3mnbxs7zkk

== Running on multiple platforms

[source,groovy]
----
task run {}
platforms.targetPlatforms.each { platform ->
    def platformRun = task "${platform}Run"(type: JavaExec) {
        dependsOn "${platform}Jar"
        classpath = files(tasks."${platform}Jar".archivePath, 
                          configurations."runtime${platform.capitalize()}")
        executable = "${platforms.jdkFor(platform)}/bin/java"
        main = 'com.acme.core.Main'
    }
    run.dependsOn(platformRun)
}
----

== Why does Gradle help?

* Add `targetPlatform 'java9'`
* Generate module descriptor automatically?
* Profit!

== Trying it out

screencast:step7[]

== Automatically generating `module-info.java`?

screencast:step8[]

== Multi-release jars

* *Good idea*: provide different versions of classes depending on runtime
* *Bad idea*: in general, dependencies will be different so should be different artifacts
* But let's give it a try...

=== Creating a MRJAR

[source,groovy]
----
task multireleaseJar(type:Jar) {
    dependsOn compileJavaJava7, compileJavaJava9
    baseName = "${project.name}-multi"
    from compileJavaJava7.destinationDir
    into('META-INF/versions/9') {
       from compileJavaJava9.destinationDir
    }
    manifest.attributes('Multi-Release': 'true')
}
----

=== Fixing the `run` configurations

[source,groovy]
----
platforms.targetPlatforms.each { platform ->
    def platformRun = task "${platform}Run"(type: JavaExec) {
        dependsOn multireleaseJar
        classpath = files(multireleaseJar.archivePath,
                          configurations."runtime${platform.capitalize()}")
        executable = "${platforms.jdkFor(platform)}/bin/java"
        main = 'com.acme.core.Main'
    }
    run.dependsOn(platformRun)
}
----

=== Create version specific classes

screencast:step9[]

== What's next?

* Making this a first class citizen in Gradle
* Automatic toolchain selection
* Toolchain provisioning
* Support for `modulepath`
* Support for `jimage` and `jlink`

== Be involved

* Specs can be found on https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/design-docs/jdk9-support.md[our GitHub repo]
